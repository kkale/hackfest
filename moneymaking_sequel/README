MONEYMAKING SEQUEL

We have a database of financial information. The schema.sql file in this
directory may be used as a reference. You can query this database using

psql -h pg -U haxor -d money
password: haxor

from the command line on the hackfest server. Or you can connect to it
using whatever tools you like.

Please provide the following, if possible (at least one of these is not
possible):

1) A list of account_ids that haven't made any transaction this month.

2) A list of account_ids that did not make any transactions last month (but
may have had transactions since then).

3) A list of names for people who owe the bank money, and how much they owe.
  Put the people who owe the most at the top of the list. Remember that some
  people have more than one account.

4) Accounts shouldn't be deleted. Have any accounts been deleted? Which?
