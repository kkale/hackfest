Rules:

- You have 60 minutes. Please complete as many of the exercises as possible.
- Exercises may be completed in any order. Some are harder than others.
  Jelly Belly might be a good starting point
- Use any tools you wish so long as it executes on the hackfest machine.
  Bash, Python, Ruby, Perl, C, C++, ObjC, and Java are on there. We will apt-get install
  anything within reason, just tell us what you need.
- Commit early, commit often. If it's not committed to your git repo, it
  didn't happen, so at least commit by the end of the night!
- For extra credit, show us how you think by showing us how your work evolves
  across commits.
- A commit history that demonstrates TDD is not considered "Just Showing Off".
