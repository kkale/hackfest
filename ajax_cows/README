AJAX COWS

In this directory, you'll find a file called `index.html`. Download this file
to your computer and open it in a browser. On the page, you'll find Bob, our
friendly office cow.

Using our official Cowsay API endpoint at `http://hackfest/cowsay`, add a form
to `index.html` that will update Bob with something new to say based on the
contents of an HTML input or textarea named "message".

Your form should make requests via AJAX and update the page without reloading.

Already included on the page is the latest jQuery 1.x.
